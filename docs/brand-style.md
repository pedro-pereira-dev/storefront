## Maison Atelier Brand Style

### Essence
- **Mood**: hushed, ceremonial calm rooted in couture ateliers.
- **Voice**: precise, bilingual phrasing that hints at concierge service.
- **Promise**: textiles composed for spatial quiet and heirloom softness.

### Typography
1. `Cormorant Garamond` — display serif for logotype, section headings, and hero titles. Tracks wide (`0.5em+`) to emphasize breath.
2. `Space Grotesk` — sans body text with uppercase microcopy to echo couture labels.

### Color System
- **Obsidian Black (`#040404`)** background gradients with translucent overlays.
- **Ink Strong (`#F2F0EC`)** as the primary text tone.
- **Ink Muted (`#B6B1A7`)** for secondary labels and dividers.
- **Metallic Linen (`#C8B99C`)** used sparingly for buttons/accents.

### Layout Tenets
- Full-width hero carousel framed by black “letterbox” bands.
- Sticky, transparent nav with tracking-heavy uppercase microcopy.
- Sections separated by generous negative space, bordered cards, and centered copy blocks.

### Motion & Interaction
- Slow carousel autoplay (~7s) with fade overlays to keep focus on fabrics.
- Buttons and dots animate via opacity shifts—no aggressive scaling.
- Menu + section selector slide open/close rather than popping.

### Copy Cues
- Lead with bilingual nods (“Maison”, “Concierge”).
- Prioritize sensory descriptors (“linen hush”, “cashmere-silk voile”).
- Calls-to-action stay soft (“Enter the maison”, “Place reservation”).

### Assets Checklist
- Hero imagery set via `public/data/hero-images.txt`.
- Translation keys documented in `src/locales/*.json` for all visible copy.
- Brand story anchored by `BrandManifest` (values section) and `ShopOverview`.
